                The following are the quick actions available on the Mapping record page.
            </p>

            <h2>Execute</h2>

            <div class="double-indent">
                <p>Opens the <b>Status Tracker</b> modal and starts execution based on the object level settings on the
                    Mapping
                    record and its associated Field Mappings.</p>
                <p>
                    If the Mapping is batchable, the execution runs in batch mode, where the Execution record is created
                    in
                    the back and the <b>Status Tracker</b> keeps the latest results (and corresponding hyperlink) at the top. The
                    source
                    data is split into
                    batches based on the <b>Batch Size</b> configured on the Mapping. Whenever a batch completes its
                    execution, the Status Tracker updates by adding the Batch Execution result right below the Execution
                    result and update the summary of the Execution result. The maximum number of batch
                    results shown in the <b>Status Tracker</b> is 200, after the first 200 batches, when a new batch
                    result
                    comes in, the
                    earliest successful batch result is removed from the tracker. To view the full list of batches, go
                    to the Related List on Execution record page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Mapping is not batchable, the execution runs in non-batch mode, where instead of tracking the
                    results of both Execution and Batch Execution,
                    only the Execution result is tracked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Click the hyperlink on the Execution Name to see the result of the Execution; And click the
                    hyperlink on
                    the Batch Name to see the details of the Batch Execution.
                </p>

                    closed, the execution continues in the back.
