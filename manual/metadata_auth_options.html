            <p>There are 3 methods of authorizing a Salesforce org, choose one of the following three options:</p>

            <div class='v-space'></div>
            <div class="image-outer">
                <img src="resource/img/connection.png" onclick="window.open(this.src)"/>
                <div class="image-title">Connection</div>
            </div>

            <div class='v-space'></div>
            <h2 id='title'>Option #1: Current Org</h2>

            <p class="double-indent">Check <span class='formula'>Is Current Org?</span> to indicate whether the current
                Connection is the current org or not. If checked, no other credential is needed, the data execution will
                run as the current user via APEX, instead of web services.</p>

            <div class='v-space'></div>
            <h2 id='title'>Option #2: Username + Password</h2>

            <div class="double-indent">
            <p>Type in your <span class='formula'>Username</span> and <span
                    class='formula'>Security Token + Password</span>, and check <span class='formula'>Is Sandbox?</span>
                if the Connection is a sandbox, and click Save.
                On the saved record, click the <span class='formula'>Test Connection</span> quick action to check if the
                credential is entered correctly. </p>
            <p>
                <div class='slds-box note-box_outer'>
                    <div class='note-box'>
                        <p class='title'>Note:</p>
                        <p><span class='formula'>Password + Security Token</span> is an encrypted text field. Users with
                            <span class='formula'>View Encrypted Data</span> permission, and having the Object, record
                            and field level access will be able to view the decrypted value.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </p>
            </div>

            <div class='v-space'></div>
            <h2 id='title'>Option #3: Named Credential</h2>
            <div class="double-indent">
                <p>In general, using the Named Credential is one of the most secure methods of authorizing an external web service endpoint in Salesforce. This
                    is because no packages or custom code can restore the crendentials defined in a Named Credential,
                    which is protected by Salesforce at the platform level. </p>
                <p>Create your Named Credential in the setup section and add its developer name into the Connection
                    record you are creating. DSP supports 2 types of Named Credentials - <span
                        class='formula'>OAuth2.0</span> and <span class='formula'>Username + Password</span>. The
                    required settings for the Named Credential are as following:</p>
                <p> Identity Type must be <span class='formula'>Named Principal</span>, Authentication Protocol must be
                    <span class='formula'>OAuth 2.0</span> or <span class='formula'>Password Authentication</span>,
                    Allow Merge Fields in HTTP Header and Allow Merge Fields in HTTP Body must be checked. Use <span
                        class='formula'>https://login.salesforce.com</span> for production and <span
                        class='formula'>https://test.salesforce.com</span> for sandbox as the URL when the protocol is
                    <span class='formula'>Password Authentication</span>.</p>

                <div class='v-space'></div>
                <div class='slds-box note-box_outer'>
                    <div class='note-box'>
                        <p class='title'>Note:</p>
                        <p><b>Remote Site Setting</b> is a key security measure that prevents API callouts to
                            unauthorized network addresses. A Remote Site Setting is required for Connections other than current org. DSP automatically creates the Remote Site Settings upon Connection creation
                            or when a Connection is updated and the credential is changed, so long as the credential is
                            valid, and the current user has the permission <span class='formula'>Customize
                                Application</span> or <span class='formula'>Modify All Data</span>. If the current user
                            does not have the permission to add a Remote Site Setting, check with your system
                            administrator and add the Remote Site Setting accordingly. DSP never adds Remote Site
                            Settings other than for the Connections authorized by your users.</p>

                        <p>There could be 3 Remote Site Settings created when a Connection is saved, if not already existing -
                            <ul>
                                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">https://login.salesforce.com</li>
                                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">https://test.salesforce.com</li>
                                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The custom domain name of the authorized org</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </div>
