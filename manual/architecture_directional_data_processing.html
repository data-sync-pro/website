            <p>

                A Directional Executable, integral to managed Salesforce data management, operates within a predefined Direction, establishing source and target connections for data synchronization. Upon creation, users select specific source and target objects, setting the stage for a wide range of Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations—insert, update, upsert, delete, undelete, and merge—toward the target object. Designed for versatility, this Executable functions as a batch job, adept at fetching data from the source, conducting matching and transformation processes, and executing actions on the target object, with the capability to run both on-demand and as scheduled, asynchronous batch jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
            Incorporating a dynamic Q (query builder) component, the Executable enhances user interaction by facilitating the construction of SOQL queries for data retrieval, directly through a user-friendly interface. This allows for selective record execution based on predetermined transformations and actions, offering synchronous operations. The Q component, notable for features like inline and mass editing, downloading, and sorting, integrates smoothly into the Salesforce Lightning Experience via the Lightning App Builder.
            </p>
            <p>
            Furthermore, when utilized within the current org as the source connection, the Directional Executable transcends its primary function, acting as a streamlined rules engine for trigger automations. By simplifying and bulkifying complex transformations and actions into user-configurable formulas, it presents a potent alternative to traditional triggers or flows, minimizing the need for extensive coding. Additionally, its adaptability extends to quick actions, enabling users to perform predefined operations with the simple click of a button, further demonstrating its utility and efficiency within the Salesforce platform.

            <p>

                With the ability of retrieving any object from any connected Salesforce org including the current org, and fully featured transformation power,
                you can use directional Executables to perform the following tasks.
                <ul>
                    <li>Local Org Batch Data Processsing</li>
                    <li>Sandbox Seeding</li>
                    <li>Orgs Merge</li>
                    <li>Data Backup &amp; Restore</li>
                    <li>Deployment of Record based Configurations</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Since DSP is a Salesforce native app built on top of the Salesforce core platform, 
                you can execute the Executables mannually from the UI, in Apex and/or Triggers, and Schedule jobs.

                DSP offers a record based Schedule Job Management where you can define your schedules by just creating a record, 
                and schedule executions by adding the Executables, Pipelines or Apex Classes to the related list of the Schedule. 

                Using the DSP Schedule management, no need to worry anymore about generating cron expressions, querying schedule frequencies,
                pausing or rescheduling from scatteered places. The schedule jobs can be easily managed in the single place under the Schedules tab without requiring dev skills.

                A standalone Executable is not associated with a Pipeline. 
                Use it to retrieve data from the Source object via SOQL query, perform transformations, 
                and action against the Target object.

                A Pipeline Executable has every capability of a standalone Executable; 
                In addtion, multiple Executables can be grouped together and associated with a Pipeline(lookup field) along with the Seq No.
            </p>


            <p class="double-indent">
                A Pipeline can be executed if all of its related Executables can be executed.
                When executing a Pipeline, DSP executes its related Executables in order based on the Seq No. 
                
            </p>



            <p class="double-indent">
                Use the Pipeline to maintain dependencies between the Objects, such as Account executes first, then the Contact etc.
