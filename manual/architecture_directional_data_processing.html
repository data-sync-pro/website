            <h1>Directional Data Processing</h1>

            <p>

                <b>Direction</b> defines the Source and Target connection. 
                A directional Executable is associated with a Direction, instead of a single Connection. 
                Based on the Executable's settings, DSP will retrieve data from 
                the Source Object in the Source connection via SOQL query, perform transformations, then action(Insert, Update, Upsert, Delete) against the Target object in the Target connection.
            </p>

            <p>
                This type of Executables are essentially batch processing engines; 
                Think them as if you were writing up batch apex classes - 
                first retrieve the data via SOQL query from the Source object, then split the data into small batches, 
                in each batch filter out not-needed data, perform transformations, then assembly target object records, and perform DML actions accordingly. 
            </p>

            <p>

                With the ability of retrieving any object from any connected Salesforce org including the current org, and fully featured transformation power,
                you can use directional Executables to perform the following tasks.
                <ul>
                    <li>Local Org Batch Data Processsing</li>
                    <li>Sandbox Seeding</li>
                    <li>Orgs Merge</li>
                    <li>Data Backup &amp; Restore</li>
                    <li>Deployment of Record based Configurations</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Since DSP is a Salesforce native app built on top of the Salesforce core platform, 
                you can execute the Executables mannually from the UI, in Apex and/or Triggers, and Schedule jobs.

                DSP offers a record based Schedule Job Management where you can define your schedules by just creating a record, 
                and schedule executions by adding the Executables, Pipelines or Apex Classes to the related list of the Schedule. 

                Using the DSP Schedule management, no need to worry anymore about generating cron expressions, querying schedule frequencies,
                pausing or rescheduling from scatteered places. The schedule jobs can be easily managed in the single place under the Schedules tab without requiring dev skills.

                A standalone Executable is not associated with a Pipeline.

            <p class="double-indent">
                
                A Pipeline Executable has every capability of a standalone Executable; 
                In addtion, multiple Executables can be grouped together and associated with a Pipeline(lookup field) along with the Seq No.
            </p>


            <p class="double-indent">
                A Pipeline can be executed if all of its related Executables can be executed.
                When executing a Pipeline, DSP executes its related Executables in order based on the Seq No. 
                
            </p>



            <p class="double-indent">
                Use the Pipeline to maintain dependencies between the Objects, such as Account executes first, then the Contact etc.
