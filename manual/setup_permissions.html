            <h1>Permissions</h1>

            <p>
                Data Sync Pro primarily utilizes Permission Sets as a fundamental mechanism for security control. This
                approach is supplemented with Custom Permissions and Sharing Rules, allowing for granular and flexible
                management of
                access rights within the system. This combination ensures robust security measures are in place to
                safeguard data and control user actions effectively.</p>

            <h2>Permission Sets</h2>

            <p>Here is the list of Permission Sets included in the Data Sync Pro package.

            </p>


            <div>

                <ul>

                    <li class="rli">
                        <strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro Administrator: </strong>grants "Modify All" access to all DSP
                        objects, and includes all custom permissions within the DSP package. This is the master
                        permission
                        for Data Sync Pro.
                    </li>

                    <li class="rli">
                        <strong>DSP: Data Sync Pro User: </strong>provides users with essential access to
                        Executables(private). If Executables are shared through sharing(read), users will be able to
                        perform
                        actions in Q, Automation, or Record Actions, but not Batches. To enable batch execution, add
                        "DSP: Create Executions".

                        <br>If an Executable record is shared with "edit" access, users are granted
                        "super user"
                        privileges for that Executable, allowing them to make necessary changes independently. However,
                        it's important to note that they are not permitted to modify the fields - Direction, Connection,
                        Source Object API Name, or Target Object API Name.
                    </li>

                    <li class="rli">
                        <strong>DSP: Create Executions: </strong> grants create and edit access to execution related
                        objects including Pipeline Execution, Execution and Batch Execution.
                        Apply this permission set in conjunction with the "DSP: Data Sync Pro User" to enable users to
                        create and edit Execution records to execute batch jobs on-demand or in schedules.
                    </li>

                    <li class="rli">
                        <strong>DSP: Create Executables: </strong>provides the create and edit permission to the
                        Executable object. Apply this permission set in conjunction with the "DSP: Data Sync Pro User"
                        to enable users to create Executables.
                    </li>

                    <li class="rli">
                        <strong>DSP: Download Data in Q: </strong>grants users the permission to download data from the
                        Q component. This is just a permission set with the custom permission "DSP: Download Data in Q"
                        enabled.
                    </li>

            <h2>Custom Permissions</h2>

            <p>Here is the list of Custom Permission included in the Data Sync Pro package. Add them to permission sets
                to grant users the appropriate accesses.
            </p>

            <div>
                <ul>

                    <li class="rli">
                        <strong>DSP: Access Q on Remote Connections: </strong>
                        If a Connection is remote, the Q component operates under the context of the integration user.
                        DSP users need this permission to run queries using the Q component from the Connection record
                        page.
                    </li>

                    <li class="rli">
                        <strong>DSP: Download Data in Q: </strong>grants users the permission to download data from the

                    <li style="list-style-type:none">

            <h2>Post-Installation Sharing Rule</h2>

            <p>


                The Executable object in Data Sync Pro features a checkbox field titled "All Internal Users Have Read
                Access?". This field is integral for setting up sharing rules post-package installation(manual setup).
                When this field
                is activated, Executables are made accessible to all internal users. Given that Data Sync Pro
                Executables function as a rules engine in automations, record actions, and executable Q components, it
                is crucial for users to have read access to these Executables in order to utilize their features. After
                installing DSP, ensure to create the sharing rule as the below screenshot, and check the field for any
                Executables that need to be accessible to all
                internal users, thereby providing the necessary access.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also note that if an Executable is enabled with automation, the "All Internal Users Have Read Access?"
                field is automatically set to true.
            </p>
