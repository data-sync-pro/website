            <h1>Upsert</h1>

            <p>
                An Upsert Executable in Data Sync Pro facilitates both the insertion of new records and the updating of
                existing records within the target object, requiring the specification of a <b>Target Matching Field</b> and
                its mapping. If the option "Use Salesforce Upsert API" is not selected, DSP conducts a preliminary check
                to determine the presence of the record within the target object. In cases where the record is already
                present, DSP executes an update operation based on the existing mappings. Conversely, if the record is
                identified as new to the target object, DSP proceeds with an insertion. Alternatively, when the "Use
                Salesforce Upsert API" option is activated, DSP bypasses the initial existence check and directly
                employs Salesforce's native upsert functionality, which necessitates that the <b>Target Matching Field</b> is
                designated as an External ID field. This approach leverages Salesforce's built-in capabilities to
                streamline the upsert process, efficiently managing data insertion or update without manual checks for
                record existence.

                        (fields in the mappings must have the exact same name as in the source object).

                        For <span class='formula'>Single Connection</span> Executables,
                        source data can be uploaded from CSV files.

                        <span class='formula'>Directional</span> Executables can be scheduled by adding the Executable records to the related list of a Schedule record.

                    <p>
                        During execution, Salesforce limitations apply. For example, when the source connection is the current org,
                        the maximum data can be retrieved is 50 million.
