            <p>
                In conjunction with Salesforce's built-in duplication management features, a Merge Executable
                facilitates the bulk merging of records associated with DuplicateRecordItem by defining criteria for
                selecting the Principal Record. These criteria could be based on various factors, such as the record
                with the Most Cases, Most Opportunities, or the Most Complete data, among other detailed logic options.
                DSP utilizes the Salesforce Merge API to consolidate these records into a Master record, simultaneously
                re-parenting the related child records. This process ensures a streamlined and efficient
                method of managing duplicates directly within the Salesforce environment.
