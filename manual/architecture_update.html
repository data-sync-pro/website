            <h1>Update</h1>

            <p>
                An Update Executable is designed for modifying data that already exists within the target object. It
                necessitates the definition of a <b>Target Matching Field</b> and its mapping, which Data Sync Pro utilizes to
                verify the presence of the record in the target object. When a record is identified in the target
                object, DSP proceeds with the update, applying changes according to the specified field-level mappings.
                Conversely, if the record does not exist in the target object—indicating it is a new entry—DSP will take
                no action, thereby ensuring that only existing records are updated. This functionality underscores Data
                Sync Pro's capability to efficiently manage and update data within targeted objects while maintaining
                data integrity.

                        For <span class='formula'>Directional</span> Executables, DSP retrieves data from the source connection or user can upload CSV files
                        (fields in the mappings must have the exact same name as in the source object).

                        For <span class='formula'>Single Connection</span> Executables,
                        source data can be uploaded from CSV files.

                    <p>
                        <span class='formula'>Directional</span> Executables can be scheduled by adding the Executable records to the related list of a Schedule record.

                        During execution, Salesforce limitations apply. For example, when the source connection is the current org,
                        the maximum data can be retrieved is 50 million.
