                Data Sync Pro employs a sophisticated set of custom objects designed to support its core functionalities
                and log activities throughout the data management process. This structured approach facilitates the
                app's operation by segregating metadata and logging information into distinct categories for enhanced
                clarity and efficiency. The metadata that governs the operational aspects of Data Sync Pro includes

            <ul>
                <li class="rli"><span class='formula'>Connections</span>, establishing links to data sources and
                    targets; </li>
                <li class="rli"><span class='formula'>Directions</span>, defining the pathways for data flow;</li>
                <li class="rli"><span class='formula'>Pipelines</span>, organizing multiple Executables in a sequence;
                </li>
                <li class="rli"><span class='formula'>Executables</span>, representing individual data manipulation
                    tasks; </li>
                <li class="rli"><span class='formula'>Field Mappings</span>, specifying how fields from source to target
                    are aligned;</li>
                <li class="rli"><span class='formula'>Schedules</span>, managing when and how often these tasks are
                    executed.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                On the logging side, Data Sync Pro maintains detailed records of its operations through objects like
                <span class='formula'>Pipeline Execution, Execution, and Batch Execution</span>. These logs are crucial
                for monitoring the appâ€™s
                performance, debugging issues, and understanding the data flow's effectiveness and efficiency during
                execution. By carefully organizing this information, Data Sync Pro ensures a high level of data
                integrity, operational transparency, and the ability to fine-tune processes for optimal performance in
                the complex Salesforce data management landscape.

                Data Sync Pro offers two primary types of Executables, tailored to address diverse data management needs
                within the Salesforce ecosystem: Directional Executables and Single Connection Executables.

            <p class="double-indent">
                Directional Executables are structured for operations that involve data flow between two different
                connections, typically a source and a target. These Executables are adept at handling complex data
                synchronization tasks, including data retrieval from the source, applying necessary transformations and
                mappings, and performing various Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations such as insert, update,
                upsert, delete, undelete, and merge on the target connection.
            </p>


            <h2><a href="architecture_single_connection_executable.html">Single Connection Executable</a></h2>
            <p class="double-indent">
                Single Connection Executables, while focused on actions within a singular connection, complement the
                functionality provided by Directional Executables by offering precise control over data queries and DML
                operations such as insert, update, upsert, and delete within the same system. These Executables are
                adept at handling specific, targeted data management tasks, providing advanced capabilities for
                filtering, matching, and transforming data. Additionally, they enable the creation of sophisticated
                query-based data lists, further enhancing data access and manipulation directly within Salesforce
                Lightning pages.
