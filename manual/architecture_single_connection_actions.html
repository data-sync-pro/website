            <h1>Single Connection Actions</h1>

            <p>
                An Executable can be associated with a single Connection with an Action of Query, Insert, Update, Upsert, or Delete.
            </p>

            <p>
                A Query Executable can be used to store a shared SOQL query, which can be used as a workable place to display, edit, delete, download data in bulk.
                The lwc "executableQ" can be used in lightning pages, lightning web components, and screen flows, which dynamically renders the component 
                defined in the Query Executable in the context of the current record.
            </p>


            <p>
                An Executable with Insert, Update, Upsert, or Delete Action can be used to perform DMLs against the Target Object in the associated Connection via CSV upload.
                Treat this type of Executables as a data loader component with filtering and tranformation capabilities.
                The logs of data uploads are stored in the Execution records, which can be used for auditing and QA purposes.
            </p>
