            <p>
                A Delete Executable enables the removal of data from the target object. It requires the specification of
                a <b>Target Matching Field</b> and its mapping, which Data Sync Pro employs to ascertain the presence of the
                record within the target object. When a record is identified as existing in the target object, DSP will
                proceed with its deletion. Conversely, if the record does not exist in the target—indicating it is a new
                or non-existent entry—DSP will take no action. This ensures that deletion is conducted only on records
                that are verified to exist within the target object, maintaining precise control over data management
                operations.

                        For <span class='formula'>Directional</span> Executables, DSP retrieves data from the source connection or user can upload CSV files
                        (fields in the mappings must have the exact same name as in the source object).

                        For <span class='formula'>Single Connection</span> Executables,

                        <span class='formula'>Directional</span> Executables can be scheduled by adding the Executable records to the related list of a Schedule record.

                        During execution, Salesforce limitations apply. For example, when the source connection is the current org,
                        the maximum data can be retrieved is 50 million.
