                        A Pipeline also supports shared configurations such as Retrieve

                        Connections, and more.

                        An Executable is the core configuration unit of DSP’s rules engines.
                        It defines the logic for processing, transforming, and acting on
                        Salesforce data—and powers all five engines: Batch, Triggers, Data
                        List, Action Button, and Data Loader.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Executables can be associated with either a Direction or a
                        Connection. When linked to a Direction, the Executable specifies the
                        source and target objects, along with the processing logic between
                        them. When linked to a Connection, it supports defining an action on
                        a target object using input from a specified data profile, or
                        creating a single data list based on a query.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Executables provide a modular, declarative, and simplified yet
                        powerful configuration model for managing complex operations within
                        Salesforce.

                      fields, expressions, and a list of predefined functions to shape the
                      data transformation.
