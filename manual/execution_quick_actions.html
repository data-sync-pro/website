            <h2>ReExecute Failed Batches</h2>
            <div class="double-indent">
                <p>Opens the <b>Status Tracker</b> modal and starts re-executing all the failed Batch Executions related to the current Execution, based on the source data IDs in the log.
                    Under the hood, DSP creates a new Execution and one Batch Execution for each Execution. 
                    Each Batch Execution is linked with the original failed Batch Execution, and the new Execution is linked with its original Execution.
                    The action only applies to batchable Executions and only when the Execution contains failed Batch Executions.
                </p>

            <h2>ReExecute</h2>
            <div class="double-indent">
                <p>
                    Re-run the original Execution, similar to the "ReExecute Failed Batches" functionality descripbed above, based on the source data IDs in the log. The difference is this action re-runs the original 
                    Execution entirely, not just the failed batches.

                    The standard Salesforce Delete quick action. As a result, the deletion also deletes all of the related Batch Executions.
