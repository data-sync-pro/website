            <p>A Job Execution(pushtopics__JobExecution__c) is a logging object that tracks the status of execution for a Job, which consists of a list of sequentially ordered Mappings. 
                Each Mapping has a corresponding <a href='execution.html'>Execution</a> record created during the Job's execution to track the individual Mapping's execution status.
                
                And all of those Mapping Execution records are assocated with the Job Execution.
