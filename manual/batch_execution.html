                A Batch Execution(pushtopics__BatchExecution__c) record has similar set of fields as an <a href='execution.html'>Execution</a>. 
                The difference is it logs the details at the batch level instead of the Execution level. A Batch Execution has a master-detail relationship with the Execution object.
