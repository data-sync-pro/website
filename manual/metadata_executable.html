            <p>
                An Executable (pushtopics__Executable__c) is a sophisticated configuration object that orchestrates object-level operations and provides a wide range of data management capabilities.
                <ul>
                    <li class="rli">Extraction of data from the source, subsequent transformation, and then performing actions on the target.</li>
                    <li class="rli">Retrieval of filtered data from any Salesforce org for flexible display on lightning pages.</li>
                    <li class="rli">Data upload via CSV files.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Key configurations encapsulated by the Executable are:
                <ul>
                    <li class="rli">Source Data Retrieval: Utilizes Salesforce SOQL to dictate data extraction methods.</li>
                    <li class="rli">Target Data Existence Check:  Includes checks for target existence via the Target Matching Field.</li>
                    <li class="rli">Target Data Action: Enables actions like Insert, Update, Upsert, Delete with detailed control.</li>
                    <li class="rli">Association with Field Mappings: Facilitates advanced field-level transformations through associated Field Mapping records.</li>
                    <li class="rli">Scope Filter: Includes in-memory checks to verify if a source record is within the defined execution scope.</li>
                    <li class="rli">Delta Load: Ensures retrieval of data that has changed since the last execution.</li>
                    <li class="rli">Execution Order: Dictates the sequence of operations during job executions.</li>
                    <li class="rli">Batch Size: Defines the quantity of data processed during each batch operation.</li>
                    <li class="rli">Logging and Notifications: Provides guidelines for tracking system activities and sending notifications.</li>
                    <li class="rli">Serial Mode Execution: Specifies if operations should run in sequence.</li>
                    <li class="rli">Trigger Execution: Enables transformation during trigger execution.</li>
                    <li class="rli">"Q" component settings: Offers granular control over the "Q" component settings, ensuring smooth integration with Lightning features.</li>
                </ul>

            </p>
            

            <p>
                In summary, an Executable is a pivotal component of the DSP system, shaping the configuration for object-level operations, aligning with field-level mappings, and providing dynamic data management capabilities through the control of its "Q" component.

            <tr><td>Action</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__Action__c</td><td>The Action DSP executes against the Target. There are 4 options:<ul><li><b>Insert</b>: only performs the 'Insert' action against the Target. If the source data already exists in the Target, the existing data will be ignored for this Action. </li><li><b>Update</b>: only performs 'Update' action against the Target. Data that does not exist in the Target will be ignored and only 'Update' is performed. </li><li><b>Upsert</b>: default option. DSP performs the 'Insert' action against the Target for non-existant data, and the 'Update' action on existing data.</li><li><b>Delete</b>: DSP performs 'Delete' action if the record exists in the target.</li><ul></td></tr>
            <tr><td>All or Nothing?</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__AllOrNothing__c</td><td>Default is 'false'. Any record failures will cause the entire transaction roll back. This can only be checked when 'Batchable' is unchecked and the Target is an integration type of Connection.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Always Transform When Records Updated?	</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__AlwaysTransformWhenUpdated__c</td><td>Used along with the 'Transform in Before Triggers?' checkbox in before update triggers. If checked, DSP will run the transformation whenever the records are updated; otherwise, the transformation will only execute when the related data's change triggered the update to the current object.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Batch Size</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__BatchSize__c</td><td>Max value is 200. Once data is retrieved from Source, the data will be split into Action batches based on the value of this field. For example: It may be a quick process to retrieve 400 records from a Source, but when actioning against the Target, due to heavy triggers/workflows/process builders which can impact the DML time, it could be better to perform the actions 50 records a time. So the 'Retrieve Size' can be set to 400, and 'Action Batch Size' be 50. This option makes it flexible to adjust the size of the batches in execution separately.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Batchable?</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__Batchable__c</td><td>Default is 'true'. If checked, the Execution will run in batch mode, where each batch ends up with a Batch Execution record created, which holds the details of a batch execution, and the Execution record holds the summarized values. If unchecked, all the details are logged in the Execution record and no Batch Execution records will be created. The non-batch mode helps reduce the layer of logs, but is only supposed to be used when the dataset is small enough to be handled within a single APEX transaction, without hitting Salesforce governor limits. 'Batchable?' and 'All or Nothing?' cannot both be checked.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Bypass Duplicate Rule Alerts?</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__BypassDuplicateRuleAlerts__c</td><td>Default is 'false'.  If checked, and if the data actioned to the Target triggers the Duplicate Rule Alert, the alert will be bypassed. <div class='slds-box note-box_outer'><div class='note-box'><p class='title'> Note: </p><p>A System Administrator will bypass the alert regardlessly whether it is checked or not.</p></div></div></td></tr>
            <tr><td>Connection</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__Connection__c</td><td>Used in single connection executables - create Salesforce DML or Query from a Connection record directly.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Delete Execution Logs After Completion?</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__DeleteExecutionLogsAfterCompletion__c</td><td>Defines what succeeded logs need to be deleted after the execution is completed.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Deployable?</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__Deployable__c</td><td>Formula field indicating whether the current Executable is deployable or the related Pipeline is deployable. It can be used in filters while migrating DSP Executables and their related Field Mappings from one environment to another.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Description</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__Description__c</td><td>Description of the Executable.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Direction</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__Direction__c</td><td>The Direction of the Executable. If not defined, the Direction of the Pipeline is used. At least one of the <b>Direction</b> and <b>Pipeline</b> fields is required.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Disable Feed Tracking(Integration Only)?</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__DisableFeedTracking__c</td><td>To disable Feed Tracking in the Target. It can only be checked when the Target is an integration type of Connection. Default is 'false'. </td></tr>
            <tr><td>Error Out If Source Attributes Missing?</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__ErrorOutIfSourceAttributesMissing__c</td><td>If checked, during execution, if there is any source attribute part of the field mappings that is missing from the payload, DSP will error out. Otherwise, DSP will treat it as NULL.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>Include Failed Data in Results?</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__IncludeFailedDataInResults__c</td><td>Default is 'false'. If unchecked, only the Ids of the data and the result from the Target will be logged in the Execution or Batch Execution records. If checked, the failed records against the Target will be added to the log in JSON format to help debug the issues. </td></tr>

            <tr><td>Transform in Before Triggers?</td><td class='slds-truncate'>pushtopics__TransformInBeforeTriggers__c</td><td>If checked, when the current object records are inserted or updated, DSP will evaluate the field values in the before trigger based on the field mappings. Any related data change such as aggregated child data is inserted/updated/deleted/undeleted, will cause the before trigger of the current Object to run and re-evaluate the fields. Add TriggerServices.execute() to the relevant objects triggers.</td></tr>
