                An Insert Executable is designed to streamline the process of adding new data into a specified target
                object. This functionality is enhanced by the provision to define a <b>Target Matching Field</b> along with its
                associated mapping, which Data Sync Pro utilizes to conduct a pre-insertion check against the target
                object's existing records. This preemptive verification step is crucial; if Data Sync Pro discovers that
                a record with the matching criteria already exists within the target object, it will automatically skip
                the insertion action for that specific record. This ensures that duplicates are avoided, and only
                records that are genuinely new and do not already exist in the target object are inserted. This method
                not only maintains the integrity and cleanliness of the data within the target object but also optimizes
                the data insertion process by preventing unnecessary duplication.

                        During execution, Salesforce limitations apply. For example, when the source connection is the current org,
                        the maximum data can be retrieved is 50 million.
